#                     be published. Try to use the following structure:
#                     1. Start with a Strong Hook: Begin with an intriguing question, startling fact, or 
#                             engaging statement to grab attention.
#                     2. Add Value or Insight: Incorporate useful and relevant information such as statistics,

#                     3. Call to Action (CTA): Encourage readers to engage further by trying out a tip,

#                             but avoid overuse.

#                     Example Post:
